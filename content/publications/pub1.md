A validation test environment for testing shared cache and TLB intervention using true sharing of a set of address buckets, where each bucket contains a fixed number of memory addresses, in order to stimulate cache coherence and memory consistency logic, is presented. Tests are run from a main microprocessor(s) and use a loop based algorithm. Each address bucket is treated as a single entity and uses its own readerâ€™s-writer lock to allow concurrent access. For creating additional stress, special instruction(s) called irritators are thrown around each bucket access randomly. The irritators include instructions that directly or indirectly modify cache line states (e.g., cache and TLB management instructions).
