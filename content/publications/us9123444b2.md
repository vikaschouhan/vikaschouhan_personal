A method of testing the coherency of data storage in a memory shared by multiple processor cores through core interconnects in a device under test (DUT) includes running test patterns including data transactions between the processor cores and the shared memory, and comparing the results of the data transactions with expected results. The test patterns include false sharing operations and irritator operations causing memory thrashing.
