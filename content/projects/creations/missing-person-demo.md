A demo implementation to search for missing people using aws rekognition. Personal data for missing people is entered into the website's database by an operator using a form on the website itself. Now, whenever a person's image is uploaded via the search page, the website searches for that person in it's image database and comes out with a list of all matching entries along with their personal information and other metadata. This website uses amazon's "rekognition" engine for it's backend to search for matching candidates.
