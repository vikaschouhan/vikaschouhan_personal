I used to use OSSv4 as the in-kernel audio drivers on my personal linux machines at home. At that time, ALSA was not mature enough and many quirkly audio cards used to have problems with that. OSSv4 used to work well with my machine. This project was started as a toy (but usable) project to control OSSv4 audio mixer from console (since I frequently use plain tty consoles as opposed to full blown GUI systems).OSSv4 didn't have enough adopters, so not good tools were available for that as compared to ALSA. This was one of them. <br/>Later on, I switched back to ALSA after few years and this project has since then left abandoned.
