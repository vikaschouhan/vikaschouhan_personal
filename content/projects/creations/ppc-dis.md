This was a toy project I developed to satisfy some of my own needs while working as a validation engineer at Freescale Semiconductor. I used to frequently encounter cases wherein I needed to convert to and fro between opcodes and their corresponding mnemonics while working on several PowerPC based SoCs. No open source tools provided what I needed at that time, so I developed it myself.
